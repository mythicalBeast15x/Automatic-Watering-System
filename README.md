# Automatic-Watering-System

## Overview
This project is a smart and efficient automatic watering system powered by Raspberry Pi. It is designed to simplify the task of watering plants by automating the process based on predefined schedules and soil moisture levels. With the integration of sensors, the system ensures that plants receive the right amount of water, promoting optimal growth.

## Features
- **Smart Scheduling:** Set watering schedules to ensure plants are watered at specific times.
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Utilizes soil moisture sensors to measure the current moisture level in the soil.
- **Watering Precision:** Adjusts watering duration based on real-time soil conditions, preventing overwatering or underwatering.
- **Web Interface:** Access and control the system remotely through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Data Logging:** Keep track of soil moisture levels and watering history for each plant.
- **Notification System:** Receive alerts and notifications about watering activities and system status.

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- Soil moisture sensors
- Water pump or solenoid valve
- Tubing and water reservoir
- Relay module
- Power supply
- Enclosure for Raspberry Pi and electronic components
